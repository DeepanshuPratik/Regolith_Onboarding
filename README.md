# Regolith Onboarding

Regolith Onboarding is a desktop application that helps users to learn and master the keyboard shortcuts and workflows of Regolith Linux. Regolith Linux is a unique distribution that combines the i3 and sway window managers with popular Linux tools to create a powerful and efficient desktop environment.

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to improve the user experience by providing a guided tour of the Regolith environment and a series of interactive workflows that teach users how to use the keyboard for various tasks. The project aims to train the user's muscle memory and enable them to use the keyboard instead of the mouse for most of their activities.

## Project Features

The project consists of two main features:

- A quick introduction that shows the user the basic keybindings and concepts of Regolith, such as workspaces, layouts, modes, etc.
- A set of workflows that cover different aspects of using Regolith, such as navigation, launching, session management, window manipulation, etc. Each workflow contains a sequence of keybindings that the user has to practice and complete.

The project offers the following workflows:

- Navigation Workflow: This workflow teaches the user how to navigate between workspaces, move applications across workspaces, and switch between displays using the keyboard.
- Launch Workflow: This workflow teaches the user how to launch common applications, such as browser, terminal, look selector, notification viewer, keybindings viewer, etc. using the keyboard.
- Session Workflow: This workflow teaches the user how to close, terminate, refresh, and logout applications using the keyboard.
- Modify Workflow: This workflow teaches the user how to change the window orientation, toggle floating mode, change layout mode, position windows, and toggle fullscreen mode using the keyboard.
